# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction
This is a study on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and the development of a predictive model for predicting heart disease from medical diagnostics and patient information

# Summary
By analyzing the prevalence of heart diseases using Logistic Regression and  Decision Trees modeling techniques, accurate predictive models were developed for identifying heart disease in patients. Additionally, differences in the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases, based on sex of the patient, were also examined. The study utilized a combined dataset, curated from five independent data sets from Europe and the USA, on patient information  and diagnostic test results. Logistic regression and decision trees were employed as predictive modeling techniques to identify patterns and relationships within the data that could predict the presence or absence of heart disease
